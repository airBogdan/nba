Knicks are 20-6 at home, on a 5-game win streak, and beat Denver 134-127 YESTERDAY with Denver's full roster. The 4-1 H2H dominance with +13.8 avg margin was achieved against healthy Denver teams.",

Houston's strong defense (109.1 DRTG) against a depleted Boston offense should create a low-scoring affair. Diversifies from the two moneyline injury plays.",
