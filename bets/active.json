Injury-adjusted projection of 194.4 gives a 20-point edge. Both teams on back-to-backs with 4 games in 7 days adding fatigue. Williams and Holmgren also questionable after leaving Phoenix game. Even with replacement scoring, this total is massively inflated.",

Injury-adjusted total of 197.3 vs line of 232.5 = 35+ point edge. Both teams on back-to-backs. Even accounting for variance and some regression, this total is far too high for two depleted rosters.",
