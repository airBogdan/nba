## Pre-Game Analysis

Focusing on two games with massive injury edges - Detroit hosting a decimated Knicks squad they just beat by 38, and Houston facing an OKC team missing their entire core including MVP candidate SGA. Taking spread and under in OKC game as independent edges (injuries suppress both sides' scoring).

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $120.00**

**New York Knicks @ Detroit Pistons** - SPREAD
- Pick: Detroit Pistons -6.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $35.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Knicks catastrophically injured - KAT out/doubtful, McBride out, Anunoby questionable (potentially 48+ PPG compromised). Detroit 20-6 at home (76.9% win rate) and just demolished NYK by 38 yesterday. Even with B2B fatigue for both, the talent disparity is massive.

**Houston Rockets @ Oklahoma City Thunder** - SPREAD
- Pick: Houston Rockets +2.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $45.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: OKC missing SGA (31 PPG MVP candidate), Williams, Holmgren, Dort, and Mitchell - essentially their entire core. Houston has Durant and Sengun healthy. Thunder's elite 22-4 home record built with full roster is irrelevant against this skeleton crew.

**Houston Rockets @ Oklahoma City Thunder** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 212.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $40.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: OKC lost ~50 PPG of production to injuries. Houston averaging just 96 PPG last 2 games. Both teams in offensive slumps with slower pace expected from OKC's makeshift lineup. Line adjusted down but not enough given the magnitude of missing firepower.

### Skipped Games

- Washington Wizards @ Brooklyn Nets: Two terrible teams with high variance - under has merit but both teams' poor defenses create uncertainty
- New Orleans Pelicans @ Minnesota Timberwolves: Zero rest for both teams after yesterday's game, Randle questionable, and Zion proved he can dominate Gobert - too much uncertainty despite Minnesota's edge
- Miami Heat @ Boston Celtics: Under looks attractive but no odds data provided and both teams on B2B creates unpredictable variance
- LA Clippers @ Sacramento Kings: Clippers lost Harden/Zubac at deadline with new players not yet available - roster disruption creates uncertainty despite strong H2H dominance
- Dallas Mavericks @ San Antonio Spurs: Spurs spread has merit but De'Aaron Fox questionable and 9.5 is a large number for B2B game - edge not strong enough
- Memphis Grizzlies @ Portland Trail Blazers: Both teams decimated by injuries/trades with new players debuting - too much lineup uncertainty
- Indiana Pacers @ Milwaukee Bucks: Giannis confirmed OUT, Kuzma and Portis questionable - Milwaukee's injury situation deteriorating despite favorable matchup
