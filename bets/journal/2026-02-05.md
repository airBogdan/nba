## Pre-Game Analysis

Heavy injury slate creates clear edges on three games where one team is catastrophically depleted. OKC missing 7 rotation players vs healthy Spurs is the strongest play. Knicks and Rockets both face skeleton crews at home.

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $115.00**

**Oklahoma City Thunder @ San Antonio Spurs** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: San Antonio Spurs (high confidence)
- Amount: $50.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: OKC is catastrophically depleted - missing SGA, Holmgren, Williams, Hartenstein, Dort, Caruso, and Mitchell. This is a G-League roster on B2B after losing by 10 to this same Spurs team yesterday. Wembanyama healthy at home is a massive mismatch. Our injury_edge bets are 2-0.

**Denver Nuggets @ New York Knicks** - SPREAD
- Pick: New York Knicks -7.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $35.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Jokic OUT is catastrophic for Denver - losing 27.8 PPG, 10 APG and their entire offensive identity. Combined with Gordon/Watson/Johnson out, Nuggets fielding skeleton crew. Knicks 20-6 at home, 8-game win streak, 4-1 H2H with +13.8 avg margin.

**Boston Celtics @ Houston Rockets** - SPREAD
- Pick: Houston Rockets -6.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $30.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Celtics decimated - missing Tatum (out), Brown (doubtful), Hauser, Simons (traded), Boucher. Houston 17-4 at home with 4th-ranked defense facing what amounts to a developmental squad. Clear personnel mismatch.

### Skipped Games

- Memphis Grizzlies @ Sacramento Kings: Both teams severely depleted with injuries on both sides creating too much uncertainty. Under has merit but prefer cleaner injury edges elsewhere.
- Minnesota Timberwolves @ Toronto Raptors: Edwards and Randle questionable status creates significant uncertainty. Conley trade disruption adds volatility. Pass on unclear situation.
- Cleveland Cavaliers @ LA Clippers: Both teams severely depleted in rematch scenario. Too much chaos with Harden personal absence and multiple injuries on both sides.
- New Orleans Pelicans @ Milwaukee Bucks: No betting lines available. Bucks missing Giannis and multiple rotation players on B2B. Cannot evaluate value without lines.
