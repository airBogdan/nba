## Pre-Game Analysis

Tonight features two of the most lopsided injury situations of the season - Denver without Jokic/Gordon/Watson/Johnson and OKC missing essentially their entire roster. Both are high-confidence moneyline plays. Adding Boston/Houston under as a diversified third bet given Boston's catastrophic injury situation removing 50+ PPG of scoring.

### Selected Bets

**Denver Nuggets @ New York Knicks** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: New York Knicks (high confidence)
- Units: 2.0
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Denver is catastrophically depleted - missing Jokic (MVP), Gordon, Watson, and Johnson removes 70+ PPG and their entire offensive identity. Knicks are 20-6 at home, on a 5-game win streak, and beat Denver 134-127 YESTERDAY with Denver's full roster. The 4-1 H2H dominance with +13.8 avg margin was achieved against healthy Denver teams.

**Oklahoma City Thunder @ San Antonio Spurs** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: San Antonio Spurs (high confidence)
- Units: 2.0
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: OKC missing 10 players including SGA (30.9 PPG), Holmgren, Williams, Dort, Caruso, Hartenstein, Mitchell - essentially their entire rotation. This is a G-League lineup vs Spurs at home (17-6) with Wembanyama healthy. OKC lost 88+ PPG of production from their top scorers alone.

**Boston Celtics @ Houston Rockets** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 224.5 (medium confidence)
- Units: 1.0
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Boston missing Jaylen Brown (28.4 PPG), Jayson Tatum, Sam Hauser, and Simons - approximately 50+ PPG of scoring gone. Both teams on B2B with fatigue. Houston's strong defense (109.1 DRTG) against a depleted Boston offense should create a low-scoring affair. Diversifies from the two moneyline injury plays.

### Skipped Games

- Memphis Grizzlies @ Sacramento Kings: Both teams on B2B with injury concerns on both sides. Memphis edge is real but capped by roster uncertainty (Aldama questionable, lost JJJ in trade). Kings dysfunction is priced in.
- Minnesota Timberwolves @ Toronto Raptors: Edwards and Randle both questionable - too much uncertainty on key players. Edge disappears if either sits. Both teams on B2B.
- Cleveland Cavaliers @ LA Clippers: Both teams severely depleted at guard post-trade. Mobley OUT for Cleveland. Too much roster chaos and uncertainty despite Cleveland's H2H dominance.
- New Orleans Pelicans @ Milwaukee Bucks: Giannis OUT makes Bucks 3-12 without him. No betting lines available. Back-to-back rematch from yesterday's OT game creates extreme fatigue uncertainty.
