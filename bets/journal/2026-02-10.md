## Pre-Game Analysis

Focusing on three high-conviction plays: Sacramento's catastrophic injury situation makes Pelicans ML a strong play, while OKC and Detroit both offer our best-performing edge type (large net rating differentials) on the road. Avoiding several games with injury-driven edges given strategy guidance about elite organizations compensating with depth.

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $55.35**

**Sacramento Kings @ New Orleans Pelicans** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: New Orleans Pelicans (high confidence)
- Amount: $23.35
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Kings missing 6 rotation players including Sabonis, LaVine, Murray, Monk (48+ PPG absent). Sacramento on 12-game losing streak with 3-26 road record. Pelicans just beat this same Kings team by 26 points two days ago. Catastrophic injury differential creates overwhelming edge.

**Oklahoma City Thunder @ Los Angeles Lakers** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Oklahoma City Thunder (medium confidence)
- Amount: $20.00
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: OKC has massive +11.6 net rating differential - our highest-performing edge type (87.5% win rate). Thunder 4-1 in recent H2H including 119-110 win at this venue 2 days ago. Elite 18-7 road record demonstrates they travel well.

**Detroit Pistons @ Charlotte Hornets** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Detroit Pistons (medium confidence)
- Amount: $12.00
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Detroit +5.7 net rating advantage with 7-2 H2H dominance (-11.2 avg margin). Elite 16-7 road record. Charlotte shoots just 39.4% FG in H2H matchups. Net rating differential is our best-performing edge type despite Charlotte's recent 9-1 run.

### Skipped Games

- Chicago Bulls @ Brooklyn Nets: Near coin-flip matchup with expected margin near zero. Only under has slight edge but both teams have poor defense which could inflate scoring.
- Memphis Grizzlies @ Golden State Warriors: Both teams decimated by injuries creating high variance. Under is tempting but injury chaos makes projections unreliable. No confirmed lines available.
- Atlanta Hawks @ Minnesota Timberwolves: Minnesota has edge but both teams on back-to-back creates significant variance. 5-5 L10 for Wolves shows inconsistency.
- Cleveland Cavaliers @ Denver Nuggets: Game projects as essentially pick'em after adjustments. Cleveland has H2H edge but Denver at home with Jokic. Too close to call.
- Milwaukee Bucks @ Orlando Magic: Magic should win but -420 moneyline offers no value. Strategy warns against large spreads with injury edges vs elite organizations like Milwaukee.
- Utah Jazz @ Miami Heat: Utah just beat Miami 2 days ago. Both teams severely depleted. High variance with zero rest for both teams.
- Philadelphia 76ers @ Portland Trail Blazers: PHI injury situation is catastrophic but Portland is a negative net rating team. Strategy cautions against injury edges vs elite organizations - PHI still has Maxey.

## Post-Game Results

**Record: 3-0 | Net: +4.0 units**

### Sacramento Kings @ New Orleans Pelicans - MONEYLINE
- Pick: New Orleans Pelicans
- Result: **WIN** (+2.0u)
- Final: Sacramento Kings 94 @ New Orleans Pelicans 120
- Winner: New Orleans Pelicans
- Reflection: The injury edge was perfectly valid - Pelicans won by the exact same 26-point margin as two days prior. When a team is missing 48+ PPG of production, on a 12-game skid, with a 3-26 road record, and just got blown out by the same opponent, the edge is as clear as it gets.

### Oklahoma City Thunder @ Los Angeles Lakers - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Oklahoma City Thunder
- Result: **WIN** (+1.0u)
- Final: Oklahoma City Thunder 119 @ Los Angeles Lakers 110
- Winner: Oklahoma City Thunder
- Reflection: The ratings edge proved valid as OKC won by exactly 9 points, matching their statistical superiority. The process was sound - we correctly identified the massive net rating differential and recent venue-specific success as the primary drivers.

### Detroit Pistons @ Charlotte Hornets - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Detroit Pistons
- Result: **WIN** (+1.0u)
- Final: Detroit Pistons 110 @ Charlotte Hornets 104
- Winner: Detroit Pistons
- Reflection: The +5.7 net rating edge and H2H dominance played out exactly as expected with Detroit winning by 6. Charlotte's recent 9-1 run was correctly identified as a potential concern but appropriately weighted below the more predictive structural advantages.
