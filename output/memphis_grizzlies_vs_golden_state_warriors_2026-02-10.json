Official NBA injury report for February 10 not yet submitted by teams[6].\n\n### Additional Context\n# Warriors Bench Performance and Guard Availability Analysis\n\n## Warriors Bench Scoring Capability\n\nThe **Golden State Warriors bench is scoring 44.5 points per game in the 2025-26 season and ranks 2nd in bench PPG among all NBA teams**[1]. This demonstrates consistent bench production, though the specific 68-point bench performance mentioned in your query exceeds their season average, suggesting that game represented an outlier rather than a sustainable baseline.\n\n**Brandin Podziemski** leads all Warriors bench players with 645 total points off the bench for the season[1], while **Buddy Hield** holds the single-game bench scoring record with 25 points off the bench on January 20, 2026 against Toronto[1].\n\n## Current Guard Availability Issues\n\nThe Warriors face significant backcourt depth challenges:\n\n**Stephen Curry** (PG) is sidelined with a **right knee injury** and will miss at least a third consecutive contest[2]. He has two opportunities to return before the All-Star break, which begins February 19, 2026[2].\n\n**Seth Curry** (SG) is listed as out with a **back injury**[2].\n\n**L.J. Cryer** (PG) is out with a **hamstring injury**[2].\n\n## Backup Guard Deployment\n\nWith the primary point guards unavailable, **Pat Spencer** has emerged as the primary replacement. Spencer recently signed a standard contract (after exhausting his two-way player eligibility at 50 games) and is expected to assume lead backcourt duties[2]. Over his last three games, Spencer averaged 15.7 points, 5.0 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 1.3 steals, and 3.7 made three-pointers[2]. He recorded a career-best 20 points, six rebounds, and four assists in 32 minutes in a recent win over the Suns[2].\n\n**De'Anthony Melton** is also listed as a candidate to see increased minutes during Curry's absence[2].\n\n## Rotation Depth\n\nThe Warriors have utilized **9 players in their core rotation over the last 10 games**, with each averaging at least 15 minutes per game[1]. This suggests adequate depth to maintain competitive bench production, though the absence of three guards (Curry, Seth Curry, and Cryer) concentrates backcourt responsibilities on Spencer and Melton.",
