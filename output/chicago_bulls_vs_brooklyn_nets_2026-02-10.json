The Chicago Bulls @ Brooklyn Nets matchup took place on **Monday, February 9, 2026** at 7:30 PM ET[2], which was yesterday relative to today's date (Tuesday, February 10, 2026).\n\nHowever, I can provide the pre-game information that was available before that matchup:\n\n### Injury Report\n\n**Chicago Bulls**\n\n- **Zach Collins** \u2013 Out (right first toe sprain)[2]\n- **Noa Essengue** \u2013 Out (left shoulder surgery)[2]\n- **Josh Giddey** \u2013 Doubtful (left hamstring strain)[2]\n- **Tre Jones** \u2013 Doubtful (left hamstring strain)[2]\n- **Jalen Smith** \u2013 Questionable (right calf strain)[2]\n\n**Brooklyn Nets**\n\n- **Michael Porter Jr.** \u2013 Out (right knee tendinitis)[2]\n- **Egor Demin** \u2013 Out (rest)[2]\n\n### Betting Lines\n\nNo betting line information is available in the search results provided.\n\n### Line Movement\n\nNo line movement data is available in the search results provided.\n\n### Recent News\n\nThe Bulls had dropped four of their last five games heading into the matchup[1]. Josh Giddey had missed Chicago's previous six games with a hamstring strain that first occurred on December 29[3], though he was upgraded to doubtful status ahead of the Nets game as an encouraging sign before the All-Star break[3]. The Nets were described as being \"near full strength\" with only two starters unavailable[3].\n\nIf you need post-game analysis or results from the February 9 matchup, I can search for that information instead.\n\n### Additional Context\n### Game Context\nThe Chicago Bulls visit the Brooklyn Nets on or around February 10, 2026, following a Nets 123-115 win over the Bulls on February 9, 2026[7]. Prior matchup on January 18, 2026, ended Bulls 124-102 Nets[5]. Bulls play at a fast pace (fourth-fastest in NBA per recent analysis)[4]; Nets rank top-five in three-point attempts, testing perimeter defenses[3].\n\n### Team Efficiency Trends (Season Averages from Recent Matchup Data)\nData from two matchup analyses (December 2025 and January 2026 views) show slight variations, likely due to update timing.\n\n#### Offensive Efficiency\n| Stat | Bulls | Nets | Notes |\n|------|--------|------|-------|\n| Off Efficiency | 1.105-1.113 | 1.082-1.084 | Bulls higher; Nets average 107.3-109.5 pts/gm, fifth-worst NBA offensive rating[1][2][3]. |\n| Effective FG% | 54.6-55.0% | 52.9-53.0% | Bulls stronger overall shooting. |\n| Points (2-pt) | 57.5-58.0 | 47.4-47.9 | Bulls rely more on 2s (Two Point Rate 57.0-58.3%). |\n| Points (3-pt) | 41.4-41.9 | 42.5-42.6 | Nets three-heavy (Three Point Rate 47.9%)[1][2]. |\n| Possessions/Gm | 105.4-106.6 | 100.5-101.2 | Bulls faster pace[1][2]. |\n| Points/Gm | 117-117.8 | 108.9-109.5 | Bulls avg 117 pts/gm[1][2][3]. |\n\n#### Defensive Efficiency\n| Stat | Bulls | Nets | Notes |\n|------|--------|------|-------|\n| Def Efficiency | 1.146-1.151 | 1.132-1.159 | Both poor (Bulls sixth-worst def rating); Nets allow 113.8-117.3 pts/gm[1][2][3][4]. |\n| Opp Effective FG% | 54.8-55.1% | 55.6-57.0% | Nets allow worse shooting. |\n| Opp Points/Gm | 120.5-122.7 | 113.8-117.3 | Bulls allow 120.5 pts/gm[1][2][3]. |\n| Opp 3-pt Rate | 38.9-40.0% | 38.2% | Nets face balanced shots (Opp Two Point Rate 60.8-61.8%)[1][2]. |\n| Opp Turnovers/Play | 10.8-11.1% | 12.4-12.6% | Nets force more[1][2]. |\n\nTrends indicate Bulls score more via paint/transition (higher pace, 2-pt points) while Nets depend on threes; both defenses vulnerable to efficient shooting, with Nets weaker on eFG% allowed[1][2].\n\n### Bulls Backcourt Status and Perimeter Defense Impact\nNo direct confirmation of Anfernee Simons (not on Bulls roster) or Josh Giddey absences in results; query mentions depleted backcourt without Simons and limited Giddey, but data lacks specifics or last-10-games perimeter stats (e.g., opp 3P% by defender). Recent Bulls game (Feb 9 loss) featured Ayo Dosunmu hitting 3s, but no injury updates[4][7]. Bulls allow high opp 3-pt volume (36.7-37.1% opp 3P%) amid fast pace and poor def rating, creating exposure to Nets' shooting (top-5 3PA)[2][3][4]. Nets' young frontcourt (Nic Claxton/Noah Clowney <13 pts/gm each) relies on perimeter scoring[3][6].\n\n### Last 10 Games Trends (Limited Data)\nResults lack explicit last-10-game efficiency breakdowns or pace/scoring distribution. Nets won Feb 9 (123-115 vs Bulls) with career nights from Claxton/Traore; lost 9-of-11 prior (12-28 record Jan 18)[4][5][6][7]. Bulls 20-22 record Jan 18 (13-9 home), allow 120.5 pts/gm overall[3][5]. Nets recent win snapped skid, boosting offense via bigs/guards[6]. Bulls def lapses (120.5 pts allowed) offer Nets three-point chances despite Brooklyn's scoring struggles[3].",
