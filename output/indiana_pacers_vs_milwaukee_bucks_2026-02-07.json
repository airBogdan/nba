Andrew Nembhard led a fourth-quarter comeback attempt for Indiana, scoring 18 of his 22 points in the final frame and cutting Milwaukee's lead to four points with 4:12 remaining, but the Bucks held on[6]. Kevin Porter Jr. paced Milwaukee with 23 points, while Bobby Portis (returning from a hip contusion) scored 21 points off the bench and sealed the game with a crucial layup[3].\n\n**Roster Moves:** The Pacers acquired center **Ivica Zubac** from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for a protected 2026 first-round pick[3]. Zubac was unavailable for the Bucks game due to an ankle injury[7].\n\n**Team Records (Pre-Game):** Indiana entered at 13-38 (.255); Milwaukee at 20-29 (.408)[2].\n\n### Additional Context\n### Haliburton Injury Status\nTyrese Haliburton is out for the Indiana Pacers @ Milwaukee Bucks game due to a right Achilles tendon tear from Game 7 of the 2025 NBA Finals, with surgery in July 2025 ruling him out for the entire 2025-26 season.[1][5]  \nOfficial NBA injury report (Feb 6, 2026, 5:30 PM) lists him as **Out** for IND@MIL.[5]  \nRecovery updates as of late January/early February 2026: Progressed to 3-on-3 and full-court 4-on-4 scrimmages, but return not expected until 2026-27 season; gained 30 pounds (from 180 to 210) for added physicality.[3][4]  \n**Game relevance**: Confirms long-term absence of primary ball-handler, forcing reliance on backups like Andrew Nembhard without timeline for change.[1][2][5]\n\n### Pacers Point Guard Situation\nNo direct confirmation in available data that the starting PG role has stabilized around Andrew Nembhard; Haliburton remains the listed star PG out long-term.[1][2][4]  \nRecent Pacers trade (reported Feb 5, 2026) acquired Kobe Brown (Out - Not With Team for IND@MIL), signaling retooling around Haliburton's future return rather than immediate PG fixes.[2][5][6]  \n**Game relevance**: Backup PG setup persists amid roster flux (e.g., Myles Turner lost in free agency, no clear center replacement), potentially exposing creation weaknesses against Milwaukee's defense.[5][6]\n\n### Offensive Efficiency and Pace Without Haliburton\nSearch results provide no specific quantified stats on Indiana's offensive efficiency (e.g., offensive rating) or pace (possessions per game) without Haliburton compared to season averages.[1-6]  \nContextual notes: Pacers described as non-contending and retooling in 2025-26 due to Haliburton's absence, with prior Finals run highlighting his role as \"engine\"; recent win (Jan 29) featured Aaron Nesmith's late heroics, not PG-led scoring.[1][6]  \n**Game relevance**: Lacks data to assess if offense sustains competitiveness (e.g., Nembhard's prior late-game creation) or declines in efficiency/pace, limiting analysis of Milwaukee exploitation potential.[1]"
