The search results reference a Miami Heat vs. Boston Celtics matchup on **Friday, February 6, 2026** at 7:30 p.m. EST[1][3], which occurred yesterday relative to today's date (Saturday, February 7, 2026).\n\nThe search results contain pre-game information from February 6, but they do not include:\n\n- **Current betting lines** for today's date\n- **Line movement analysis** for a future matchup\n- **Recent news** from the last 48 hours that would be relevant to an upcoming game\n\nIf you're interested in:\n1. **Post-game analysis** from yesterday's Heat-Celtics game, I would need different search results\n2. **Pre-game information for a different upcoming Heat or Celtics game**, please specify the date and opponent\n3. **The injury report from yesterday's game**, I can provide that from the available search results\n\nPlease clarify which game you'd like researched, and I'll provide the information in the format you've requested.\n\n### Additional Context\n### Miami Heat's Two-Game Losing Streak\nMiami lost to Boston on February 6, 2026, falling 98-96 after leading by 22 points at halftime (59-38).[2][1] Andrew Wiggins and Norman Powell combined for 50 points, but Miami was outrebounded 50-42, with Boston holding edges in blocks, free throws, and points in the paint.[1] This marked Miami's second straight loss, following a prior defeat not detailed in recent results; earlier, Miami held a three-game road win streak entering a January matchup vs. Boston (lost 119-114 on Jan. 16).[5] These losses highlight Miami's vulnerability in close games and rebounding battles against Boston's physicality, relevant for this divisional rematch where board control decided the latest outcome.[1]\n\n### Boston Celtics' Five-Game Win Streak\nBoston extended its streak to five wins with the 98-96 comeback over Miami on February 6, improving to 34-18 and reclaiming second in the East.[1][2] Prior wins included a third straight over Dallas on February 4 or 5 (33-10 record post-win, Payton Pritchard 26 points off bench).[6] The streak followed a January 28 loss to Atlanta (117-106, dropping to 29-18), snapping an earlier run.[3] Boston aims for a sixth straight vs. New York next.[4] This momentum stems from resilience in deficits and key contributions from Jaylen Brown, Payton Pritchard, and Derrick White (all 20+ points vs. Miami).[1][2]\n\n### Boston's Defensive Performance During Win Streak\nBoston's defense showed variability: vs. Miami (Feb 6), they overcame a poor shooting night with superior rebounding (50-42), blocks, and paint points, limiting Miami after halftime (outscored 36-15 in Q3).[1][2] Season defensive average is 109.9 points allowed, but they surrendered 117 to Atlanta on Jan 28 amid Tatum's Achilles absence and frontcourt issues.[3] No direct stats on five-streak defense vs. similar offenses (e.g., Miami's profile: 121.7 points, 45.1% FG in recent 10 games).[5] Rebounding dominance vs. Miami matters for this matchup, as it offset offensive struggles in a low-scoring grinder (final 98-96).[1]\n\n### Injuries and Roster Status\n**Celtics (from Feb 6-7 reports):**\n- Nikola Vucevic: Debuted Feb 6 with 11 points, 12 rebounds, 4 assists in 28 minutes post-trade deadline.[1][2]\n- Earlier issues: Jayson Tatum out (Achilles), Neemias Queta out (illness) on Jan 28.[3]\n- Conflicting older report: Jaylen Brown out (hamstring), Sam Hauser out (thumb), Tatum out (Achilles), Vucevic out (not injury related), Chris Boucher out (personal)\u2014likely outdated as Brown scored vs. Miami, Vucevic played.[5]\n\n**Heat:** No specific injuries noted in recent game vs. Boston; Wiggins and Powell active (50 points combined).[1][2] These absences thinned Boston's frontcourt earlier but recent adaptation (e.g., Vucevic addition) aided streak, impacting depth for repeat vs. Miami's scoring duo.[1][5]\n\n### Relevance to Miami's Offensive Profile\nMiami averages 121.7 points (recent 10 games), relying on high-volume scoring like Wiggins/Powell (50 points Feb 6).[1][5] Boston contained this to 96 points despite 22-point lead, via third-quarter surge and rebounding\u2014key as Miami shot well early but faltered late.[2] Boston's season marks: 116.6 points scored, 109.9 allowed, with 22-12 conference record.[4][3] Streak defense held a high-output Heat team under 100, but prior Atlanta game (117 allowed) shows risks vs. up-tempo attacks similar to Miami's 29.7 assists/game.[3][5] Rebounding edge (50-42) directly countered Miami's 51.4 rebounds/game average.[1][5]"
